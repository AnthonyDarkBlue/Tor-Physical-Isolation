Tor Physical Isolation computer setup.
Computer needs atleast 2 ethernet ports for this to work.
Updated (17-10-2022) Tested on debian-9.8.0-amd64-xfce-CD-1.iso
LOG: clear instructions.

1. starting point.
login as root "sudo su" or "sudo -i"
“apt update”

2. Install needed packages.
“apt install ranger inxi tor dhcpcd5 dnsmasq”

3. Avoid dnsmasq & systemd-resolved conflicts.
Open a terminal and write:
"sudo nano /etc/systemd/resolved.conf"

Uncomment "#DNSStubListener=no"
If its not there just add the line:
"DNSStubListener=no"

CTRL+O to save, CTRL+X to exit.

Download and setting up the script.
"sudo -i"
"wget https://github.com/AnthonyDarkBlue/Tor-Physical-Isolation/archve/master.tar.gz"
"tar xvpfz master.tar.gz"
"sudo ranger"

Enter that extracted directory (Tor-Physical-Isolation) and copy (Y) the script to your machine root, (P) to paste it.

To make the extracted scripts executable enter the following commands to each of them.
"chmod 777 start"
"chmod 777 stop"

4. Edit ./start script
Current internet interface

In the current ./start script enp3s0 is your current interface name from your active network connection (ISP home connection) going to your machine.
See "inxi -n" to know what to replace it with. (or "ip addr" instead of inxi "inxi -n")
Replace enp3s0 with the one status: up.

Now replace enp1s0 with the name of your second interface name in the ./start script. 

5. The computer is done, you will not use this computer for anything with an exception to run the Tor Physical Isolation script.
This computer is now an onion router, it protects you from most possible leak.

6. How to use.

 - 1: Open a terminal and type: "sudo ./start" in the same directory where you placed the script.
 - 2: Or "./start" when yo are logged in as root account.
 
 - Issue "sudo ./stop" or "./stop" when you wanna stop the script.
 
 
 - 3: Put another cable into your Tor Physical isolation computer, then connect that cable to a safe workspace (maybe even an encrypted one if needed)
 - 4: And enjoy.
