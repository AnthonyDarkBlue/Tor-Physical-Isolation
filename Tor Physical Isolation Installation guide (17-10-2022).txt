Tor Physical Isolation computer setup.
Computer needs atleast 2 ethernet ports for this to work.
Updated (24-10-2022) Tested on debian-11.5.0-amd64-netinst.iso
LOG: clear instructions.

Create a debian bootable device, boot it up follow through the promts to set it up.
In the end when selecting additional software, uncheck everything! even standard system utilities.

Now, you are probably left with a CLI install of debian 11, 
To make this work you have to follow strict instructions because of certain changes. (availability of Tor V2 and V3 in the repos)

1.First of all, log in as root.

2.Edit your sources list.
"nano /etc/apt/sources.list"

Comment out each repository you see there and add the following repositories underneath.

deb http://deb.debian.org/debian/ stretch main contrib non-free
deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian/ stretch main contrib non-free

deb http://deb.debian.org/debian/ stretch-updates main contrib non-free
deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian/ stretch-updates main contrib non-free

deb http://deb.debian.org/debian-security stretch/updates main
deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian-security stretch/updates main

CTRL+O to save, CTRL+X to exit.

3. Now update.
"apt update"

4.Install needed packages.
“apt install tor dhcpcd5 dnsmasq”

5.Avoid dnsmasq & systemd-resolved conflicts.
"nano /etc/systemd/resolved.conf"

Uncomment "#DNSStubListener=no"
If its not there just add the line:
"DNSStubListener=no"

CTRL+O to save, CTRL+X to exit.

6.Kill dnsmasq as it interferes with your networking.
"systemctl stop dnsmasq"

7.Some packages arent available in the repositories where we pulled Tor V2 from.
So we have to edit the sources.list again..
"nano /etc/apt/sources.list"

Now, remove the entries we added in step 2.
Uncomment your original entries. (the repositories from debian 11)

8.Install some more packages.
"apt install wget ifupdown iptables ranger"

9.Download and unpacking the script
"wget https://github.com/AnthonyDarkBlue/Tor-Physical-Isolation/archve/master.tar.gz"
"tar xvpfz master.tar.gz"

10. Making the scripts executable
"cd /Tor-Physical-Isolation-main"
"chmod 777 start"
"chmod 777 stop"

11. Edit ./start script
Current internet interface

In the current ./start script enp3s0 is your current interface name from your active network connection (ISP home connection) going to your machine.
See "inxi -n" to know what to replace it with. (or "ip addr" instead of inxi "inxi -n")
Replace enp3s0 with the one status: up.

Now replace enp1s0 with the name of your second interface name in the ./start script. 

12. The computer is done, you will not use this computer for anything with an exception to run the Tor Physical Isolation script.
This computer is now an onion router, it protects you from most possible leak.

How to use.

 - 1: Open a terminal and type: "sudo ./start" in the same directory where you placed the script.
 - 2: Or "./start" when yo are logged in as root account.
 
 - Issue "sudo ./stop" or "./stop" when you wanna stop the script.
 
 
 - 3: Put another cable into your Tor Physical isolation computer, then connect that cable to a safe workspace (maybe even an encrypted one if needed)
 - 4: And enjoy.
