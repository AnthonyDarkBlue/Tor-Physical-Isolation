# Tor-Physical-Isolation
Tor Physical Isolation script for debian based ditro's

A script based on the OnoionPi script, modified for desktop use.
Meant for a desktop with atleast 2 ethernet ports, one to the ISP and one to the the safe workspace (much alike Whonix)
More info in the guide file..

the script can be started with: sudo ./start
the script can be stopped with: sudo ./stop

Last tested on Xubuntu 16.04.6 LTS (02-07-2022)
Doesnt appear to work on new debian based distros.
